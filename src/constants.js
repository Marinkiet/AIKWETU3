    "frog": "🐸 Frog – I breathe through my skin and lungs. In Biology, I show complete metamorphosis: egg → tadpole → adult. Amphibians are environmental indicators too!",
    "tree": "🌳 Tree – I absorb CO₂ and release oxygen. A mature tree can store over 20kg of carbon per year, contributing to climate regulation.",
    "teacher": "👩‍🏫 Teacher – I’m a living human sharing knowledge, and I represent social structures and communication in subjects like Life Orientation and Psychology.",
    "student1": "🧠 Student 1 – I use neurons and synapses to learn! Fun fact: your brain uses 20% of the body’s energy, even at rest.",
    "student2": "🎓 Student 2 – As a teenager, I’m going through adolescence, a key concept in Human Reproduction and Psychology.",
    "carrot": "🥕 Carrot – Rich in beta-carotene, I convert to vitamin A in the body. In Natural Sciences, I’m used to study root vegetables and nutrient absorption.",
